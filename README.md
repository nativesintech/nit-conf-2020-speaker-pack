Wela'lin, thank you, speaker.

We are here to create space for you to inspire and lift up yourself, your people, and your beliefs. You may speak to any topic, style your talk however you want, and make your presentation yours.

> At your preference, you may send us any video file (preferably in `mp4`). To skip the rest and do exactly that, [**click here**](#uploading).lk

Still, we do not wish for this to be a burden on you. We have prepared a template which you may choose to use, or adapt as you please.

We have also prepared a tutorial on how to get pretty heckin' good at the extremely powerful, open source, [Open Broadcaster Software](https://obsproject.com/), so you can sharpen your skills, or learn something entirely new.

Again, you can use anything, but we've consulted with speakers from conferences [RustFest](rustfest.eu/) and [RustConf](https://rustconf.com/) about how they did it, and we want to share with you.

# Uploading

You have some options, don't worry.

If you have your own space to host your video where we can download it (such as your own website, and a direct link to the file, please *do not use a Youtube embed or otherwise.* Just drop the file into the host.)

If you have a Google account that you're comfortable signing in with, you can drop your presentation in to [this dropbox](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hrT3D_XS3mn22tS6lDhgLYw9Qe54-8zY?usp=sharing) after signing in.

If you'd prefer not to have a Google account, please email [operator@hoverbear.org](mailto:operator@hoverbear.org) and we will set up a bucket for you to upload to with `s3cmd`.
